# My Simple Java Site

This is a simple Java site using the EL tag (Expression Language) and the JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) for the views.
This Java site to multilingual support (i18n).

It works perfectly with the Tomcat application server, but it should also work well with all other servers.
Use Eclipse or Maven (you must write a pom.xml file for this) for a file .war

Note: This is a personal project and is working but some classes do not work properly (e.g. UserAcl and AdminACL with the filters) because they are not made for the project architecture (it is indeed necessary to make some changes).
Implementing a blog and a member's area are also not usable as-is.
